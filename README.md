# Getting Started

Run docker compose start from command line within the root directory of this project.

Login with admin/admin.

After services start you can run the install_amps.sh and install_jars.sh scripts in the installs folder to load up
OOTBEE tools (https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools)
and a mechanism to execcute httpclient style transactions from a javascript in a rule.

Pretty straight forward...

### note

There's a container called wildsalfmcp that will start up an MCP server for use with coPilot or Clause desktop etc.

If you want to run a local model with a dedicated chat client, you must install ollama on your computer. Once installed pull a model in terminal (ollama pull llama3). The start (or restart) the doocker services. You can access the open-webui interface with http://localhost:3000. Configure the tools under settings to point to http://localhost:8001
