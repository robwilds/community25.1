# Getting Started

Run docker compose start from command line within the root directory of this project.

Login with admin/admin.

After services start you can run the install_amps.sh and install_jars.sh files to load up
OOTBEE tools (https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools)
and a mechanism to execcute httpclient style transactions from a javascript in a rule.

Pretty straight forward...
